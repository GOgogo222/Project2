# [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)



## 题目



Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.



Example:



```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2



Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```







## 题目大意



计算二叉树的最小深度



## 解题思路



递归求出根节点到叶子节点的深度，输出最小值
