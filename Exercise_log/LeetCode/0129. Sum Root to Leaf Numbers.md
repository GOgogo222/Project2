# [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.cn/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)



## 题目



You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.



Example:



```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
