# [817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.cn/problems/linked-list-components/)


==理解难==

## 题目



You are given the `head` of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array `nums` that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return _the number of connected components in_ `nums` _where two values are connected if they appear **consecutively** in the linked list_.



Example:



```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2


Explanation:
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.


Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2


Explanation:
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```
